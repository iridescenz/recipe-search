Web app for recipes search (in progress)

https://iridescenz.netlify.app

Recipe search - search for vary of recipes (drinks and dishes) (https://www.edamam.com - Recipe Search API).
Query examples: 'apple pie', 'chicken curry', 'ceasar salad', 'mimosa drink' etc.
Will be updated soon, so user will be able to specify dishtype, maybe calories, etc.

Low carb search - searches for low carb and keto recipes (https://www.edamam.com - Recipe Search API, diet - lowcarb).
Query examples: 'keto waffles', 'low carb ice cream', low carb dough', 'low carb pie' etc. 
I'm not happy with the results, some of them not low carb at all, but that's what free api can offer.

Nutrition facts - shows information about product nutritional value, energy, vitamins and shows percent from daily value. (https://www.edamam.com  - Nutrition Analysis API)
User must indicate product name and product weight (!) to get nutritional information, will be fixed soon (shoul specify default weight of the product).
Query examples: '100 gram beef', '30 gr chicken liver', '5 oz almonds', '2 slices bread' etc.

Home page in progress, soon information will ba added - recipes of different dishtypes, like breakfast ideas, dishes with eggs, sandwiches etc, not decided yet 😅.
